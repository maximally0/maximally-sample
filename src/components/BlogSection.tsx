          <p>
            You've seen them. Those probiotic bottles with "50 BILLION CFUs!" slapped on the label like it's some sort of flex. 
            Brands love throwing <strong>big numbers and fancy buzzwords</strong> at you, hoping you won't ask the real question: 
            <em>Do they actually work?</em> Spoiler: <strong>Most don't.</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I got sick of seeing people waste money on <strong>useless probiotics</strong>, so I did what any sane person would doâ€”I 
            <strong>fixed the entire industry</strong>. Welcome to <strong>Maximally</strong>â€”where probiotics actually do what they're 
            supposed to do.

          <h3 className="font-bold text-xl mt-8 mb-4">What's Wrong With Today's Probiotic Supplements?</h3>

            </h4>
            <p>
              Most probiotics don't even make it past your stomach acid. Brands stuff their supplements with bacteria that die the 
              moment they touch stomach acid, rendering the supplement <strong>completely useless</strong>. What's the point of buying 
              "50 billion CFUs" if they all die before reaching your gut? It's like paying for WiFi and getting dial-up speeds.

            </h4>
            <p>
              Not all probiotics are created equal. Some strains actually do something, while others are just filler. Most brands 
              <strong>randomly mix strains together</strong>, hoping something sticks. That's like making a pizza by dumping 
              <strong>random ingredients into an oven and praying for a miracle.</strong> It doesn't work like that.

            </h4>
            <p>
              Probiotics need <strong>prebiotics</strong> (their food) to survive in your gut. Yet, most brands leave them out. 
              That's like planting seeds in dry soil and expecting a jungle to grow.

            <p>
              "Doctor Recommended." "50 Billion CFUs." "Revolutionary Formula." Sounds good, right? Well, here's a secret: 
              <strong>there are no regulations on these claims.</strong> A company could slap "GUT HEALTH MIRACLE" on a bottle 
              of sugar pills, and nobody would stop them. That's the wild reality of the supplement industry.

            </h4>
            <p>
              Many probiotic strains need <strong>proper storage</strong> or they die. But brands <strong>never tell you this.</strong> 
              So, that probiotic bottle sitting on the store shelf for months? Yeah, it's probably filled with corpses. You're swallowing 
              <strong>dead bacteria</strong> and expecting miracles.

          <p>
            At <strong>Maximally</strong>, I decided to fix every single issue in the industry. No gimmicks, no BSâ€”just 
            <strong>science-backed probiotics that actually work</strong>.

            </h4>
            <p>
              We use <strong>enteric-coated capsules and spore-forming probiotic strains</strong> that don't die the second they hit stomach acid. 
              Your probiotics <strong>actually reach your gut alive</strong>â€”which, believe it or not, is kinda important.

            <p>
              We don't throw in random strains for the sake of it. Every probiotic in <strong>Maximally</strong> has been 
              <strong>scientifically tested and proven</strong> to improve gut health. No filler, no fluff, just <strong>results</strong>.

            <p>
              We give probiotics the <strong>food they need to thrive</strong>. Because without prebiotics, probiotics are just 
              lost tourists in your gut with no idea where to go.

          <h3 className="font-bold text-xl mb-4">Why I Built Maximally</h3>
          
          <p>
            I didn't start <strong>Maximally</strong> because I wanted to sell another "gut health" product. I started it because 
            I was <strong>frustrated with all the trash on the market</strong>. People deserve probiotics that actually do what they claim.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            This brand isn't just about selling supplementsâ€”it's about <strong>fixing an industry</strong> that's been full of 
            misleading claims and underwhelming products for too long. <strong>You deserve better. Your gut deserves better.</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            So here's Maximallyâ€”the probiotic supplement that actually makes sense.
