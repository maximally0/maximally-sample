              <p>
                You've seen them. Those probiotic bottles with "50 BILLION CFUs!" slapped on the label like it's some sort of flex. 
                Brands love throwing <strong>big numbers and fancy buzzwords</strong> at you, hoping you won't ask the real question: 
                <em>Do they actually work?</em> Spoiler: <strong>Most don't.</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                I got sick of seeing people waste money on <strong>useless probiotics</strong>, so I did what any sane person would doâ€”I 
                <strong>fixed the entire industry</strong>. Welcome to <strong>Maximally</strong>â€”where probiotics actually do what they're supposed to do.
              </p>
              
              <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-cyan-800 mt-8 mb-4">What's Wrong With Today's Probiotic Supplements?</h4>
              
              <div className="mb-4">
                <p className="font-bold">ðŸš¨ 1. They're Dead on Arrival</p>
                <p>
                  Most probiotics don't even make it past your stomach acid. Brands stuff their supplements with bacteria that die the moment they touch stomach acid, 
                  rendering the supplement <strong>completely useless</strong>. What's the point of buying "50 billion CFUs" if they all die before reaching your gut? 
                  It's like paying for WiFi and getting dial-up speeds.
                </p>

                <p className="font-bold">ðŸš¨ 2. Useless Strains, Random Formulations</p>
                <p>
                  Not all probiotics are created equal. Some strains actually do something, while others are just filler. Most brands 
                  <strong>randomly mix strains together</strong>, hoping something sticks. That's like making a pizza by dumping 
                  <strong>random ingredients into an oven and praying for a miracle.</strong> It doesn't work like that.

                <p className="font-bold">ðŸš¨ 3. No Food, No Growth</p>
                <p>
                  Probiotics need <strong>prebiotics</strong> (their food) to survive in your gut. Yet, most brands leave them out. 
                  That's like planting seeds in dry soil and expecting a jungle to grow.

                <p className="font-bold">ðŸš¨ 4. Buzzwords > Science</p>
                <p>
                  "Doctor Recommended." "50 Billion CFUs." "Revolutionary Formula." Sounds good, right? Well, here's a secret: 
                  <strong>there are no regulations on these claims.</strong> A company could slap "GUT HEALTH MIRACLE" on a bottle of sugar pills, 
                  and nobody would stop them. That's the wild reality of the supplement industry.

                <p>
                  Many probiotic strains need <strong>proper storage</strong> or they die. But brands <strong>never tell you this.</strong> 
                  So, that probiotic bottle sitting on the store shelf for months? Yeah, it's probably filled with corpses. 
                  You're swallowing <strong>dead bacteria</strong> and expecting miracles.

              <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-cyan-800 mt-8 mb-4">How Maximally Fixes Everything</h4>
              <p>
                At <strong>Maximally</strong>, I decided to fix every single issue in the industry. No gimmicks, no BSâ€”just 
                <strong>science-backed probiotics that actually work</strong>.
              </p>
              
              <div className="mb-4">
                <p className="font-bold">âœ… Probiotics That Actually Survive</p>
                <p>
                  We use <strong>enteric-coated capsules and spore-forming probiotic strains</strong> that don't die the second they hit stomach acid. 
                  Your probiotics <strong>actually reach your gut alive</strong>â€”which, believe it or not, is kinda important.
                </p>
              </div>
              
              <div className="mb-4">
                <p className="font-bold">âœ… Clinically Researched Strains That Do Something</p>
                <p>
                  We don't throw in random strains for the sake of it. Every probiotic in <strong>Maximally</strong> has been 
                  <strong>scientifically tested and proven</strong> to improve gut health. No filler, no fluff, just <strong>results</strong>.
                </p>

              <div className="mb-4">
                <p className="font-bold">âœ… Prebiotics Included â€“ Because Science</p>
                <p>
                  We give probiotics the <strong>food they need to thrive</strong>. Because without prebiotics, 
                  probiotics are just lost tourists in your gut with no idea where to go.
                </p>
              </div>
              
              <div className="mb-4">
                <p className="font-bold">âœ… No BS Labels, No Buzzword Overload</p>
                <p>
                  No fake claims. No exaggerated numbers. What you see on the label is exactly what you get.
                </p>

                <p>
                  No more worrying about storage. Our probiotics are <strong>shelf-stable and survive longer</strong> without dying. 
                  You get <strong>full potency</strong> from the first capsule to the last.
                </p>

              <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-cyan-800 mt-8 mb-4">Why I Built Maximally</h4>
              <p>
                I didn't start <strong>Maximally</strong> because I wanted to sell another "gut health" product. 
                I started it because I was <strong>frustrated with all the trash on the market</strong>. 
                People deserve probiotics that actually do what they claim.
              </p>
              <p>
                This brand isn't just about selling supplementsâ€”it's about <strong>fixing an industry</strong> that's been full of 
                misleading claims and underwhelming products for too long. <strong>You deserve better. Your gut deserves better.</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                So here's Maximallyâ€”the probiotic supplement that actually makes sense.
